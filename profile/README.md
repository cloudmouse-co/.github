# 🐭 CloudMouse

**ESP32-powered IoT devices meet cloud intelligence**

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to CloudMouse - where we're building the next generation of smart IoT devices that are actually smart, not just "connect-to-wifi" smart.

## What's this all about?

[CloudMouse](https://cloudmouse.co) is a complete ecosystem for creating ESP32-based IoT devices that seamlessly integrate with cloud services. We're talking real-time data, WebSocket magic, beautiful LVGL interfaces, and hardware that doesn't suck.

Our stack:
- **Hardware**: ESP32-S3 custom boards with PSRAM
- **Firmware**: Dual-core architecture (Core 0 = networking, Core 1 = UI)
- **Cloud**: Real-time WebSocket connections, device management, data pipelines
- **Apps**: Home Assistant integration, Forex tracking, weather stations, emergency alerts, and more

## What you'll find here

Browse our repos to discover:

- 📦 **CloudMouse SDK** - Core libraries and utilities for building CloudMouse applications
- 🎨 **Applications** - Ready-to-flash apps (Home Assistant, Forex, Weather, Emergency Alerts)
- 🛠️ **Tools** - Flashing scripts, device provisioning, documentation generators
- 📚 **Documentation** - API references, tutorials, hardware guides

## Why Contribute?

We're building this in the open because IoT should be accessible, hackable, and fun. Whether you're into:
- Embedded systems and low-level optimization
- Cloud infrastructure and real-time data
- UI/UX design with LVGL
- Hardware design and prototyping
- Documentation and community building

There's a place for you here.
